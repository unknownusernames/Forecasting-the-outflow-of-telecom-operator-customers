# Forecasting-the-outflow-of-telecom-operator-customers
## Project description:
Telecom operator "Notasinglegap.com" wants to learn how to predict the outflow of customers. If it turns out that the user is planning to leave, he will be offered promo codes and special conditions. The operator's team collected personal data about some customers, information about their tariffs and contracts.
## Project objectives üéØ:
Develop a machine learning model to predict the outflow of telecom operator customers, which will help the business retain customers
## Brief conclusion from the project‚úçÔ∏è:
Three machine learning models were trained - these are *RandomForest*, *CatBoostClassifier* and *LogisticRegression*, the results of cross-validation of which showed, that taking into account optimization, the fastest but least accurate model (Cross-val ROC-AUC score = 0.74) turned out to be *LogisticRegression*, and the most accurate, but the slowest is CatBoostClassifier with an indicator of the target metric ~0.93 on cross-validation and 0.91 on test data.
